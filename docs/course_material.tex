\section{Contents and learning goals}\label{contents-and-learning-goals}}

\textbf{Contents and learning goals}: This course provides an introduction to microbiome data science with R/Bioconductor, a popular open source environment for scientific data analysis. A special emphasis is given to multi-omic data integration methods. After the course you will know how to organize multiple data sources into a coherent framework, implement reproducible data science workflows, and approach common data analysis tasks by utilizing available documentation and R tools. Whereas the primary focus is on microbiome research, the covered data science methods are generally applicable and we will discuss links with other application domains such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, and single cell sequencing.

\textbf{Target audience}: MSc students, PhD, postdoctoral, and other researchers who wish to learn new skills in statistical programming and data analysis. Academic students and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to apply.

\textbf{Teaching material}: We will follow open online documentation created by the course teachers, primarily the \href{https://microbiome.github.io/OMA}{Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis} (OMA) book. The training material walks you through the standard steps of omics data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, and reproducible workflows. Preparatory material and video clips, and online support are available before the course. All teaching materials are shared openly.
