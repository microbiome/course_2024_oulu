A special emphasis is given to multi-omic data integration methods. After the course you will know how to organize multiple data sources into a coherent framework, implement reproducible data science workflows, and approach common data analysis tasks by utilizing available documentation and R tools. Whereas the primary focus is on microbiome research, the covered data science methods are generally applicable and we will discuss links with other application domains such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, and single cell sequencing. Target audience: MSc students, PhD, postdoctoral, and other researchers who wish to learn new skills in statistical programming and data analysis. Academic students and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to apply. Teaching material: We will follow open online documentation created by the course teachers, primarily the Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) book. The training material walks you through the standard steps of omics data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, and reproducible workflows. Preparatory material and video clips, and online support are available before the course. All teaching materials are shared openly. Figure source: Moreno-Indias et al.

Costs: Registration is free. Participants are expected to cover their own travel and accommodation. Accommodation: Housing tips can be found at https://visitoulu.fi/en/arrival-overnight/. Schedule: Contact teaching daily between 9am – 5pm, including lectures, demos, practicals, and breaks. For a detailed schedule, see Section 2. The course can be extended by an independent assignment (details to be agreed with the main teacher). 1.3 How to apply Send a brief motivation letter to Anna Kaisanlahti anna.kaisanlahti@oulu.fi. In your letter, please describe your skill level in R coding using scale 1-5 (1 = no previous experience, 5 = advanced level), and your previous experience related to bioinformatics. Applications from local students, and applications sent before 11 November 2024 will be given priority. The course has maximum capacity of 20 participants. The enrollment to the course will be confirmed within few days after the application deadline (Nov 11). Applications received after 11.11 will also be considered in case there are slots still available. 1.4 Before the course For self-learning, visit this site. 1.5 Teachers and organizers Teachers: Leo Lahti is the main teacher and Professor in Data Science at the University of Turku, and a certified Carpentries Instructor. PhD researcher Tuomas Borman is a co-teacher and main developer of the data science framework used in the course. Anna Kaisanlahti (Oulu) is a course assistant, and Docent Justus Reunanen is the course coordinator.
